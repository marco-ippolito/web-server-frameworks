## Agenda

## Announcements

* Extracted from **web-server-frameworks-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/web-server-frameworks

* Review and update documented http strategy [#102](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/issues/102)
Will be discussed at the next collaborator summit
* URL's on incoming requests [#71](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/issues/71)
Consensus is that itâ€™s probably not worth implementing `req.url` due to insecurity and possible vulnerabilities, we should document how to do it manually, and possibly implement it in the next http stack.
* Future of HTTP High Level API Design [#60](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/issues/60)
Marco is working on the next http stack, created his own repo and will link it to the next-http one.
