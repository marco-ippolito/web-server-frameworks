Last meeting https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/pull/94/files 

* What is the scope of the WG -> discussion in an issue Jean Burellier
    * Paolo: One of the topics last time was to provide a universal layer for HTTP (including HTTP 1/2/3…)
    * Paolo: Is the group only around HTTP for Web or do we also want to include other part of the “web” (smtp? What should we support or not)
    * Marco: we should stay open and broad. Some technologies like cookies are not specific to HTTP. Scope should be between networking to web frameworks
    * Jean: Maybe we have some hierarchy about the part we want to focus on, from webstreams or http as they would influence all of them
    * Paolo: Standard request / response
    * Marco: Web URL parsing to become standard (Paolo: maybe ping yagiz)
    * All: we need to find a good name that would show and be easy to understand what the group is doing (Client / Server Group)
    * Marco: delay discussion on an issue - not just low level network but not framework focussed
* Do we want to include specific part of the projects (internal or external but close) like:
    * lmhttp
    * Jean: do we want to include in the group some core / mandatory part of the project to help with the support ? 
    * Cluster
    * Compression
        * brotli or other tools
    * net module
    * Close should stay “contained” for the start of the team, and what would be our core objectives and what people want to work on -> Open an issue

* Splitting work between low level and high level
    * Low level:
    * High level: 
    * But first start by researching specific part of the project to create the definition and see what would be the matter / how do we want to operate

* Standardization
    * Work with WinterCG and other standardization groups
    * improve developer experience between the full ecosystem
    * provide some module not part / included by node but maintained by this group
	* collaboration with other runtimes

* Cookies
